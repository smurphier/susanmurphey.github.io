    These are pictures that remind me of where I've been, and where I hope to go. 
    I've been forturnate to have time to travel lately, and the memories make that time precious to me as almost nothing else could do.
    Abu Simbel in Egypt, New Kingdom temple ruins.
    The Olympic arena in Athens, Greece. With a near-Olympian, my college roommate.
