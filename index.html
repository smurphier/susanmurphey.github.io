      <li>Above is me in front of the Olympic arena in Athens, Greece. With a near-Olympian, my college roommate.</li>
      <li>Below I am wandering around Abu Simbel in Egypt, an amazing New Kingdom temple in ruins, but with lots and lots of heiroglyphic inscriptions and relief art carvings, and even a little bit of original painted color still visible in places.</li>

      These are pictures that remind me of where I've been, and where I hope to go. 
      I've been forturnate to have time to travel lately, and the memories make that time precious to me as almost nothing else could do.
